`sqlx-utils`, is designed to streamline database interactions using the `sqlx` library. It provides a convenient macro, `sql_filter`, for defining filter structs that can be applied to SQL queries, and the `repository` macro to easily set up repositories. The changes also include traits for models and repositories, error handling, and utility functions for batch operations. It also handles multiple database feature flags.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

**1. `sql_filter` Macro:**

This procedural macro allows you to define filter structs based on a simple SQL-like syntax.  It generates code that implements the `SqlFilter` trait for these structs. This trait defines how the filters are applied to `sqlx` query builders. The macro supports several SQL operators like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `IN`, and `NOT IN`. It also handles optional fields and provides the flexibility to use raw SQL strings when needed.

**2. Filter Implementation:**

- **`src/filter/operators.rs`**: This file defines the core filter operators and their logic. It uses other macros like `sql_operator` and `sql_delimiter` to generate boilerplate code for each operator.
- **`src/filter/mod.rs`**: This module provides a `Filter` struct that wraps the generated filter structs and provides methods like `and`, `or`, and `not` for combining filters.

**3. `repository` Macro:**

This macro simplifies the creation of database repositories. It generates a new struct with a reference to the database pool. Optionally, if a model is provided, it can also implement the `Repository` trait automatically. The macro includes methods for inserting, updating, and deleting records, both individually and in batches. It supports three kinds of ways to interact with the database: with model, without model, or with default implementations.

**4. Repository Implementation:**

- **`src/traits/repository.rs`**: Defines the `Repository` trait, providing methods for interacting with the database. This includes basic CRUD operations and more advanced batch operations for better performance.
- **`src/utils/batch.rs`**: Implements the `BatchOperator` struct, used by the repository for efficient batch processing.

**5. Model Trait:**

- **`src/traits/model.rs`**: Defines the `Model` trait, providing a standardized way to identify database models. This trait is used by the repository for operations like saving and deleting.

**6. Error Handling:**

- **`src/error.rs`**: Defines the `Error` enum and `Result` type for consistent error handling throughout the crate.

**7. Database Pool:**

- **`src/pool.rs`**: Provides a global database pool using `OnceLock` and functions for initializing and accessing the pool.

**8. Types:**

- **`src/types/mod.rs`**: Defines several type aliases like `Query` and `Pool`, likely to reduce boilerplate and improve readability.

**9. Support for Multiple Databases:**

- The build script (`build.rs`) detects if multiple database features (like "postgres", "mysql", "sqlite") are enabled and defaults to the "any" feature in that case, issuing a warning about potential conflicts.  This ensures that the crate remains functional even if a user accidentally enables multiple database features.

**10. Feature Flags:**
- Conditional compilation based on feature flags is heavily used in macros like `db_pool`, `db_type`, `sql_operator` and `sql_impl`, allowing for specialization based on the target database.

**11. Dependencies:**

The Cargo files show that the crate depends on `sqlx`, `tokio` (for asynchronous runtime), `futures` (for concurrent operations), and several other utility crates.  The `sqlx-utils-macro` crate depends on `syn` and `quote` for procedural macro development.

This crate offers a cleaner, more organized way to interact with databases using `sqlx`, promoting code reusability and maintainability. The combination of the `sql_filter` and `repository` macros, along with the well-defined traits and error handling, makes it a robust and potentially useful tool for Rust developers working with SQL databases.
